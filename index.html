    <h1 class="title">Hi, I'm Evelyn Jun.</h1>
    <p class="description"> I'm an early-stage VC scout in the San Francisco Bay Area who writes about tech, startups, and product culture. At Stanford, I studied Management Science & Engineering, a blend of operations research, economics, and organizational science. I love the dynamism of the Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurship community and believe in being a good friend and supporter for founders.
